## Projects from Comp3311 in UNSW

----------------------------------
Unfortunately, my unsw github account is expired after I graduated uni...  

Basically, what I have done in this course is   

ASST1 - converting a give ER design to a data base schema expressed in PostgreSQL  
ASST2 - Extracting information as making queries and functions expressed in PostgreSQL needed to be found in 'MyMyUNSW' database (which is about information of staff and students in UNSW)  
ASST3 - building some useful data access operations on the Internet Moview Database(IMDB) as writing Python scripts and using the Psycopg2 module   

You can see how it looks on this link I attached which other student uploaded in his personal github channel.
