Question
1. where are the enemy radius and support radius range functions?
-> just int value + battle에서 비교 구현, 프론트엔드에서 원형 구현?
2. enemy moving randomly?
3. should we standardlise all initial values, e.g. initial hp etc?
-> in movingentity => yes
4. what is susceptible to stake weapon in "Vampires have high damage, are susceptible to the stake weapon, and run away from campfires. "?

5. for applyEffect function, there is a chanceOfTriggering function, I don't want to implement inside the applyEffect function, because this function is for applying effect already, not for checking the prequisitions. I think I will implement chanceOfTriggering function in MovingEntity abstract, but if anyone else need this function, just let me know, I will move it to Entity so everyone can use it.

6. should I implement attack function in moving entity? this function can set new hp, status of enemy etc. So in controller, just need to call if (within range) {enemy.attack(character); character.attack(enemy)} in a for loop.
-> I think it is a good idea
